    "#### Syntax Dependency Parsing\n",
    "Syntax dependency parsing, as might be inferred by the name, is a process by which a string of words can be placed into a formal grammar structure.  I use these terms loosely, as the definition of a \"word\" or the formalization of a \"grammar structure\" can be interpreted in many different ways.  For the purpose of this assignment, we'll use the lay definition of a \"word\" - i.e. words of a language, and \"grammar structure\" can be taken to mean the series of hierarchical relationships different words have to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do I mean by this?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consder the sentence \"I eat cake\".  With a basic understanding of english grammar, we can immediately identify \"I\" to be the subject, \"cake\" to be a direct object, and \"eat\" to be a verb relating the subject and direct object.  If we were to think of this sentence programmatically, we might translate the sentence to:\n",
    "```\n",
    "eat(\"I\", \"cake\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the function, or verb, to \"execute\" correctly, it needs two arguments: a subject and a direct object.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of thinking can be extended to higher complexity phrases, but this will be left as an exercise to the reader."

    "#### Supervised Learning of Dependency Parsing\n",
    "One challenge in creating a way to programmatically determine the dependency structure of written language is that a formal set of grammar rules is often not available.  In addition, trying to use a purely rules-based approach can be challenging or impossible if trying to parse languages the programmer is not familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can approach dependency parsing as a supervised learning problem.  Using \"golden\" dependency data, we can train a program to create \"rules\" which maximize the accuracy of dependency trees on that data, then apply those rules to new, unseen data to obtain a dependency tree."

    "\n",
    "The arc $i \\rightarrow j$ specifies a dependency relationship from $j$ to $i$, and we can say that the **head** of the dependency is $w_i$ and its **dependent** is $w_j$."
